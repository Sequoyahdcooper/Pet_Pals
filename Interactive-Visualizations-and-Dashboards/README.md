Belly-Button Biodiversity


Belly-button bacterial data was used with Plotly to create charts on a webpage to investigate belly-button biodiversity.


-First, D3 was used to read in the JSON data.

-Next, a horizontal bar chart was used to show the top 10 sample values for each individual.

-After that, a bubble chart was created to show all sample values vs OTU ID for each individual, with marker size increasing by sample 
value.

-Finally, a panel was utilized to display the demographic information for each individual.

-A dropdown menu was included to allow users to choose which individual they want to investigate, with the panel and charts being updated
upon selection.
